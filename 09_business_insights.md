### 1. Overall Business Health

#### i] How are total sales and profit trending over time?
ANS:    Sales show a clear upward trend over time.
        Profit grows irregularly and is more volatile.
        Revenue growth is stronger than profit growth.
Interpretation:

The business is successfully selling more, but revenue growth is not consistently translating into profit growth.

#### Are sales growth and profit growth moving together or diverging?
ANS: Sales and profit do not always move together.
     Higher sales often come with lower profit margins.
     Indicates discounting and cost pressure.

#### Which periods show abnormal spikes or drops, and why?
ANS Sales spikes without profit spikes occur during high-discount periods.
    Profit drops despite stable sales indicate loss-making promotions.
    Discounting is the primary driver of anomalies.



  ###  2. Customer Analysis


#### Who are the top revenue-generating customers?
    A small set of customers contributes a disproportionately high share of sales.
    These customers place large or frequent orders.
    They are critical for top-line growth.

#### Who are the top profit-generating customers?


#### Are high-sales customers always high-profit customers?
    High sales ≠ high profit.
    Many high-sales customers receive heavy discounts, reducing margins.
    Profitability depends more on pricing discipline than volume.

#### What percentage of total revenue comes from the top 10% of customers?
    Roughly 60–70% of total revenue comes from the top 10% of customers.
    Indicates high revenue concentration risk.
    Losing a few key customers would significantly impact revenue.


#### 3. Product Performance
Q: Which products generate the highest sales?
A:
A small group of products contributes the majority of total sales. These are typically high-demand, frequently purchased items that drive revenue volume.

Q: Which products generate the highest profit?
A:
The most profitable products are not always the highest-selling ones. High-profit products usually have strong margins and receive minimal discounts.

Q: Are the best-selling products also the most profitable?
A:
No. Many best-selling products show lower profit margins due to aggressive discounting. High sales volume does not guarantee high profitability.

Q: Which products have high sales but low or negative profit?
A:
Several products exhibit high sales but low or negative profit, primarily due to heavy discounts, high shipping costs, or low-margin pricing structures.

Q: Are there products that should be discontinued or repriced?
A:
Yes. Products with consistently negative profit despite strong sales should be reviewed for repricing, cost optimization, or discontinuation.

#### 4. Category & Sub-Category Insights

Q: Which product categories contribute the most revenue?
A: Technology and Furniture generate the highest revenue, driven by high-ticket items and frequent purchases.

Q: Which categories contribute the most profit?
A: Furniture contributes the highest profit despite lower sales than Technology, indicating stronger margins.

Q: Are any categories high volume but low margin?
A: Yes. Technology shows high sales volume but comparatively lower profit margins due to discounting.

Q: Which sub-categories are consistently loss-making?
A: Certain Furniture and Office Supplies sub-categories consistently show negative profit, often due to high discounts and logistics costs.

Q: Should the business focus or reduce certain categories?
A: The business should focus on high-margin categories and review or reduce low-margin, loss-making sub-categories.

#### 5. Regional & Geographic Performance

Q: Which regions generate the highest sales?
A: The West and East regions generate the highest sales.

Q: Which regions generate the highest profit?
A: The West region is the most profitable overall.

Q: Are there regions with high sales but poor profitability?
A: Yes. Some regions show strong sales but weak or negative profit, indicating cost or pricing issues.

Q: Which regions have negative profit trends?
A: The South region shows consistently lower and sometimes negative profit trends.

Q: Should marketing or logistics strategy change by region?
A: Yes. Region-specific pricing, discounting, and logistics optimization are required to improve profitability.

### 6. Discount Impact (VERY IMPORTANT)

Q: How does discount level affect profit?
A: Profit decreases as discount levels increase, showing a strong negative correlation.

Q: Is there a discount threshold where profit turns negative?
A: Yes. Discounts above ~30% frequently result in negative profit.

Q: Which products suffer the most from heavy discounting?
A: High-cost Technology and Furniture products are most affected by heavy discounts.

Q: Are discounts being used effectively or destructively?
A: Discounts are often used destructively, increasing sales volume at the expense of profit.

Q: Should the company cap discounts at a certain level?
A: Yes. Discounts should be capped below the level where average profit turns negative.

A: Yes. Certain customers and regions repeatedly contribute to losses.

Q: Is the business growing revenue at the cost of profit?
