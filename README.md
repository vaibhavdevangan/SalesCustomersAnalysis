# 📊 Superstore Sales Analytics & Data Warehouse Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a retail superstore sales dataset using **data warehousing principles, SQL analytics, Python-based exploratory analysis, and business-focused visualizations**.
The goal is not just to create charts, but to **extract actionable business insights** that help leadership improve profitability, optimize discounts, and make data-driven decisions.

## 🎯 Business Objective

* Understand overall business performance (sales & profit)
* Identify profit leakage and loss-making areas
* Analyze customer, product, category, and regional performance
* Evaluate the impact of discounts on profitability
* Provide **clear strategic recommendations** backed by data

---

## 🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains transactional-level retail sales data including:

* Orders, customers, products, regions
* Sales, profit, quantity, discounts
* Order and shipping dates

The raw dataset was **normalized** into a relational schema to support scalable analytics.

---

## 🏗 Data Warehouse Schema Design

The flat dataset was split into structured tables following best practices:

### Tables:

* **customers** – customer details and segments
* **products** – product, category, and sub-category data
* **regions** – geographic hierarchy
* **orders** – fact table containing sales, profit, discounts, and dates

This separation improves:

* Data integrity
* Query performance
* Analytical flexibility

* Are there customers who consistently generate losses?

### 3️⃣ Product Performance

* Which products generate the highest sales?
* Which products generate the highest profit?
* Are best-selling products also most profitable?
* Which products have high sales but low or negative profit?
* Should some products be repriced or discontinued?

### 4️⃣ Category & Sub-Category Insights

* Which categories drive most revenue?
* Which categories drive most profit?
* Are some categories high volume but low margin?
* Which sub-categories are consistently loss-making?

### 5️⃣ Regional Performance

## 📈 Analysis & Visualization

* Time-series analysis for sales and profit trends
* Category and product-level profitability comparison
* Customer contribution and Pareto (80/20) analysis
* Discount vs profit relationship analysis
* Region-wise performance comparison

Visualizations were intentionally kept **simple and interpretable**, focusing on clarity over complexity.

---

## 💡 Key Insights

* Sales growth does **not always translate into profit growth**
* Heavy discounting significantly erodes margins beyond a threshold
* A small % of customers contribute a large share of revenue
* Some high-selling products consistently generate losses
* Certain categories and regions act as profit drains

---

## 🧾 Business Recommendations

* Cap discounts beyond a profitability-safe threshold
* Reprice or discontinue consistently loss-making products
* Focus marketing and retention on high-profit customers
* Optimize regional strategies for low-margin regions
* Shift focus from pure revenue growth to **profitable growth**

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

* **SQL (PostgreSQL)** – data modeling and analytical queries
* **Python** – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Jupyter Notebook** – analysis and visualization
* **Git & GitHub** – version control and documentation

---

## 📚 What I Learned

* Designing analytical schemas from flat datasets
* Writing business-oriented SQL queries
